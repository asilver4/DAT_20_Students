# GA DAT 20 NYC Assignment #2

## i) My name is Glenn Blasius

## ii) I am currently in an interesting position.  Having worked on Wall St and in the “Square Mile” of London for a long time, I am now taking time to reinvent myself and to spend time looking into new business opportunities.  I am a firm believer in the power of big data, and would like to explore business opportunities which use big data.   

## iii) I have worked with data during my entire career - initially as an analyst, then as a trader of mortgage backed securities, then as a portfolio manager sifting through portfolio data provided by banks.    The work I’ve done on data is simplistic relative to the world of data scientists, but it is interesting.   In many cases, it was important to be able to arrive at investment conclusions from sparse or dirty datasets.   

## iv) I want to be challenged, learn more about data science, meet interesting people, and hear about interesting ideas for changing the world!

## v) Here’s a recent article applying big data analysis to genetics…fascinating!
